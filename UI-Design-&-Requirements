## Goal

The goal of the initial version of AdviseU is to provide students and advisors with a simple and intuitive interface for generating, viewing, and adjusting course plans. The focus is on user-friendliness, accessibility, and the ability to visualize course schedules in a clean, efficient manner.

## Target Users
- **Students**: Students at OSU who want to generate optimal course plans based on their degree requirements, interests, and timeline.
- **Advisors**: Academic advisors at OSU who want to help students develop balanced course plans, track degree progress, and make adjustments to their schedules.

## Core UI Components

### 1. **Dashboard**
   - Displays the user’s current course plan and degree progress.
   - Provides easy access to key actions such as generating a new plan, viewing course details, and adjusting schedules.

### 2. **Course Planner**
   - Allows students to create and modify their course plan.
   - Displays available courses in a particular term, course requirements, and when each course is offered.
   - Users can drag-and-drop courses into specific terms (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer).
   
### 3. **Degree Progress Tracker**
   - Visual representation of the student’s progress toward their degree.
   - Shows required, completed, and remaining courses.
   - Color-coded to indicate the status of each course (e.g., completed, planned, required).

### 4. **Course Details Modal**
   - Popup window or modal that displays detailed information about a selected course.
   - Shows course title, description, prerequisites, credits, and availability for the upcoming term(s).
   - Includes an option to “Add to Plan” or view alternative courses.

### 5. **Term View**
   - Displays a summary of the student’s current plan for each term.
   - Users can view a snapshot of the number of credits, courses, and course difficulty for each term.

## UI/UX Requirements

- **Responsiveness**: The UI should be fully responsive and work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Simplicity**: The interface should be clean and intuitive, minimizing unnecessary complexity.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Provide visual feedback to users when actions are performed (e.g., adding a course, updating the plan, saving changes).
- **Error Handling**: Clearly indicate when a course cannot be added to the plan due to conflicts (e.g., prerequisites not met, course not offered).

---

## Stretch Goals

- **Course Recommendation Feature**: Suggest courses based on the student's interests, completed courses, and degree requirements.
- **Schedule Conflict Detection**: Automatically detect and highlight schedule conflicts when adding or adjusting courses.
- **Collaborative Advising Tool**: Enable students and advisors to work together in real-time on course planning.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the app for quick access to course planning and degree progress tracking.
